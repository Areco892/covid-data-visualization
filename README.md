# Covid Analysis - Data Visualization
In this repository, we will do some data visualization on the Covid dataset obtained from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. 

## Technologies Used
- Tableau - Dashboard with tables and graphs
- VSCode with PostgreSQL from Microsoft extension - SQL queries
- Google Sheets - Convert sql tables to xlsx

## Setup
- Download the SQL queries from: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Tableau%20Portfolio%20Project%20SQL%20Queries.sql.
- Convert the tables generated by the SQL queries into xlsx files using Google Sheets.

## Acknowledgement
This project is a continuation from a video I stumbled previously from Alex The Analyst. However this time, this repository will focus on the technique from the youtube video titled "Data Analyst Portfolio Project | Tableau Visualization | Project 2/4" from Alex The Analyst, again very cool stuff! So, I created this repository to practice my data visualization skills using Tableau and also to keep track of my progress in becoming a Data Analyst.
